        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by     Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1] [2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application  called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,   which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
